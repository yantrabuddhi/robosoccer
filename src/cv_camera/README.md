ROS OpenCV camera driver
========================
It is very easy to capture video device if we use cv::VideoCapture of OpenCV.

This is a modified cv_camera package, to allow vertical flipping of the video input to correct for the upside-down mounting of the Senz3D on one of our robots.

cv_camera_node
------------------
This node uses [camera_info_manager](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_info_manager) for dealing with camera_info.
If no calibration data is set, it has dummy values except for width and height.

### Publish ###

* ~image_raw (sensor_msgs/Image)
* ~camera_info (sensor_msgs/CameraInfo)

### Service ###

* ~set_camera_info (sensor_msgs/SetCameraInfo)

### Parameters ###

* ~rate (double: default 30.0) publish rate [Hz].
* ~device_id (int: default 0) capture device id.
* ~frame_id (string: default "camera") frame_id of message header.
* ~image_width (int) try to set capture image width.
* ~image_height (int) try to set capture image height.
* ~camera_info_url (string) url of camera info yaml.
* ~file (string: default "") if not "" then use movie file instead of device.

Nodelet
-------------------

This node works as nodelet (cv_camera/CvCameraNodelet).
